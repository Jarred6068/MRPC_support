* discovered that we had set the GMAC function to report the nominal p value calculated as


		nominal.p.value = 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs((test.wald - mean(wald.stat))/sd(wald.stat))))

Therefore all plots up this point that use "Obs GMAC permutation pvalue" need to be changed to 

		"Obs. GMAC nominal pvalue

*The nominal pvalue measures the distance between the center of permutation distribution of t-stats and the observed
 t-value for beta_1 in the regression


*Need to add in nominal pvalue calculation for simulation tests

*So far it appears there may be a difference between the raw permutation pvalue and the nominal pvalue
*need to check this difference between GMAC obs perm and GMAC obs nominal
